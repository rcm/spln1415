A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an
interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value
- you can wrap it around you dent@vogon.com for warmth as you bound across the cold
moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded
beaches of Santraginus V, foo@bar.bar.com inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can
sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert
world of Kakrafoon; use it john.smith@blah.org to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy
river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to- hand-combat; wrap it round your
head to ward off glom@flop.net noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes
that if you can’t see it, it can’t see you - daft as a bush, but very
ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress ola@ole.ola@i.com
signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be
clean enough.
